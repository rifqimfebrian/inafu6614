# 1. Introduction

Clearly state your research questions. Motivate your study and describe the policy context. 

You are by no means required to use the same section organization included in this template, this is just one approach to help you structure your reports.

1. Apakah UHI memiliki exposure yang berbeda terhadap certain communities di US?
2. Apakah tiap kota memiliki karakteristik exposure terhadap UHI yang sama? case NYC sama NH.
3. Apakah NYC cooling initiative works? 


# 2. Background

More policy background here (if necessary, otherwise fold into Section 1). 


## 2.1 Disproportionate Exposure

- Why targeting vulnerable communities matter?
- Inter-city different of characteristic to exposure

## 2.2 Cooling NYC initiatives

- What is Cooling NYC initiatives?
- How is it going so far?


# 3. Data description

Describe data sources, the population represented in your analysis, and any other context the reader should know about the data as it pertains to the analysis you do. More details can be included in a data appendix if necessary -- see [here](https://www.cssny.org/pages/false-narrative-data) for an example.

## 3.1. Demographic Data

- from ACS
- highlight poverty, race, age, gender

## 3.2. Urban Heat Island (UHI) Intensity

- from Chakraborty CS.
- What is UHII?

## 3.3. Tree Census Data in 1995 and 2015

- from NYC open data

## 3.4. NYC control variable

- from NYC open data
- housing, building, energy

## 3.4. Urban data

- from 

# 4. Descriptive statistics

## 4.1. Exposure to UHI
- Distribution of UHI (y) of demographic status (age, sex, race, poverty)
- using plots and diff-in means

## 4.2. NYC Cooling Initiative
- Distribution of UHI (y) of tree progress (x)
- using plots and diff-in means

Describe the distribution of the key variables youâ€™re analyzing. Focus mostly on your treatment or policy variable(s) of interest (X) and how they vary across relevant groups and/or time, as well as your outcome(s) of interest and any key covariates that need to be accounted for. 

You'll probably want to include difference-in-means tables or plots, and/or time series plots of key variables (by subgroups, when appropriate), like the below example:

```{r sumstats}
vf_diff %>% kable(align = "l",
                  caption = "Your Title Here",
                  booktabs = TRUE,
                  col.names = c("Variable", 
                                "Mean (Java)", 
                                "N (Java)", 
                                "Mean (Sulawesi)", 
                                "N (Sulawesi)", 
                                "p-value")) %>% 
            kable_styling(latex_options=c("scale_down",
                                          "hold_position",
                                          "striped"))
```

You can also add notes with more documentation of any technical details.

**A few extended formatting options:**

- The latex marker **FloatBarrier** holds tables and graphs in a fixed position relative to your text. 
- The **kableExtra** package gives you additional control over how your tables (kables) look when rendered into latex
- If you are working with stargazer (e.g. to display regression output) make sure you use **results = "asis"** in your code chunk header

\medspace \FloatBarrier

```{r graph 1, fig.cap="Put your title here", fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
 
ggplot(data = ym_race, 
       aes(x = date, y = si_1000, group = black75)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = black75)) +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Shutoff rate per 1,000 residents",
       color = 'Census tract racial composition') +
  ggtitle("Tract racial composition vs. Shutoff rate")
```

Make sure X and Y are clearly labeled and the units are clear.

# 5. Empirical strategy

Carefully describe the econometric methods you use and main regression specifications using clear and unambiguous notation.

Please use Ed Discussion to share clarifying questions with your classmates and instructors.

## 5.1. Exposure to UHI in US major cities

## 5.2. NYC cooling Initiatives


# 6. Findings

Can be split into multiple sections if appropriate.

This is a sample bulleted list:

- Finding 1: I like R
- Finding 2: Except on the days I don't
- Finding 3: R is great

## 6.1. Exposure to UHI in US major cities

## 6.2. NYC Cooling Initiatives


# 7. Conclusion

Summarize your key findings and policy implications of these findings. Discuss the limitations of your analysis and next steps.

# 9. Appendices

Use appendices for more detailed data description, and supplementary tables or charts that provide supporting information that is useful but not central for the story you are telling with your data.
